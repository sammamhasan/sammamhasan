Hello, I am Nasimul Hasan. I am studying Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Information Technology and Sciences.

I am currently working as a Campus Ambassador at Youth Advancement Institute. I am working in their IT department and helping them build their website. I became the best Campus Ambassador of the month there.
I also worked as a Youth Facilitator at Swap.

I like to do Web Design. I like interacting with people and I feel good doing it. When I am not working I usually play football with my friends. I love to play football.

Skills:  HTML / CSS
